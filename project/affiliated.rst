SunPy Affiliated Packages
=========================

What is an affiliated package?
==============================

Affiliated packages are well-maintained, open source software packages
that are useful to solar physicists and integrate well with the SunPy
ecosystem. To aid discoverability, all affiliated packages are listed on
the SunPy website, and they are advertised at national and international
conferences and workshops.

A SunPy sponsored package is an affiliated package that is maintained
and governed by the SunPy project.

Open review process
-------------------

The review process for becoming a SunPy affiliated package is supposed
to be approachable, lightweight and open. Reviews are conducted in
GitHub issues on the https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy.org
repository.

Steps for Getting New Packages Reviewed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0. If you’re not sure whether to submit your package for the affiliated
   package review process, you can open an issue to informally discuss
   your package or contact the Affiliated Package Liason to discuss your
   package privately.
1. Open a new issue with the issue template.
2. The Affiliated Package Liason will identify an independent reviewer.
3. The reviewer evaluates the affiliated package against the review
   criteria.
4. The reviewer adds their review as a comment to the issue.
5. Based on the scores in each of the seven categories, the affiliated
   package is either accepted or given provisional status.
6. Based on the scores, the submitting author can decide if they want
   their package displayed on the website.
7. The submitting author can challenge the review and ask for another
   reviewer. In this case, the Affiliated Package Liason will identify a
   new independent reviewer. This new review will be added to the same
   issue.
8. If the review passed the review criteria then the submitting author
   opens a pull request to add their package to the Sunpy.org
   `affiliated package
   website <https://sunpy.org/project/affiliated>`__.
9. The Affiliated Package Liason merges the pull request.

Steps for Getting Existing Packages Reviewed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Existing affiliated packages will be reviewed once per year. Developers
may challenge a new review which requires the editors to get an external
reviewer to perform the review.

Existing provisional affiliated will be reviewed once per year by the
editors. They must still be working towards meeting the rest of the
review criteria.
